# Description
This Project focusses on comparing performance of **ARIMA, Autoregression and LSTM** to forecast temperature of Ireland. 

## DataSet
The Dataset contains hourly data of Ireland for the year 2017. Dataset can be found at: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=aimsir17

## Overview of AutoRegression, ARIMA and LSTM

### AutoRegression:
Auto Regressive (AR) model is a model used in time series forecasting where we forecast the variable of Interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable. The term autoregression indicates that it is a regression of the variable against itself.
